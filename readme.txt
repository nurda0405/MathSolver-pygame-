Hi! This is a game I am working on as a project for my programming subject at school.

The game requires math mental calculations on your mind. There are squares on the screen that I call 'cells', some of which contain a number and others contain math operators: adding and substracting.
The goal of the player: is to construct a path from the first cell until the last cell in which the result of constructed algebraic expression is the value of last cell.

Hot keys in the game:
1. Press F5 to restart the game;
2. Press number-pad Enter to look to the right path;
3. Press Z to undo the last move;
4. Press Space to erase all selected cells.

The message about the loss or win will be shown in the terminal.

There are some errors shown in description of algorithms file. If you wish to collaborate with the development of this game, please create your branch and pull request!
